# HKN Wiki

This repository houses the Dr. Everitt's Neighborhood wiki and is powered by Mkdocs + material theme.

## Setup

1. Make sure you've installed Python and pip
2. Install pipenv: `pip install --user pipenv` or `brew install pipenv` (for mac)
3. Clone the repository into a folder of your choise

## Working on the Wiki

1. In the wiki folder, run `pipenv install; pipenv shell`. This will install dependencies and activate a python virtual environment.
2. Run `mkdocs serve`. You can see a preview of the docs site at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
3. Make changes. The website in your browser will update automatically.
4. You should make your changes on a separate branch and follow the same pull request flow outlined on the [website](https://github.com/hkn-alpha/website).

## Content Structure

The _title_ of a markdown file is defined to be the first level-1 heading it contains (that is, the text after a single `#`).

The _navigation menu_ of a folder is defined to be the top navigation bar for the `docs` folder, and otherwise:

- if folder is a direct child of `docs`, the left sidebar
- otherwise, within a dropdown under its parent folder

**Content rules**:
Consider an arbitrary folder `f`. The file `f/index.md` _must exist_ and is the first file users will see when they navigate to that folder. Any other files `f/xyz.md` will be displayed on the navigation menu corresponding to this folder. The navigation menu places the title of `index.md` first, followed by the titles of any other files, sorted by alphabetical order of _file name_ (so, you should name all your other files using the format `1.thing.md`, `2.thing.md`, ... to enforce ordering). The folder `f` will be placed into the navigation menu for its parent folder under name `f`. Thus, your folder names should be descriptive.

This is pretty formal so it's probably easier to just see what's in the `docs` folder and learn by example.

### Cross-listed courses

For cross-listed courses with sections that differ by department (i.e. CS374/ECE374), create a wiki page for _both_ courses. For all other cross-listed courses, only create an ECE course page, and configure a redirect in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
- redirects:
    redirect_maps:
      "Course Wiki/CS Course Offerings/CS123.md": "Course Wiki/ECE Course Offerings/ECE456.md"
```

### Tagging Pages

The very top of each wiki page should contain relevant tags, in the format below:

```
tags:
  - Signal Processing
  - Another Tag
```

You should only use tags specified in the `allowed_tags` section in `mkdocs.yml`. If the tag you want to add is missing from `mkdocs.yml`, add it. Please make sure to only have _one spelling_ of each tag in the `mkdocs.yml` file.

## Editing

Anyone is welcome to submit a PR. PRs must be reviewed by a member of the HKN website team before being merged.

### Modifying the Course Graph

Each semester, you should regenerate the following files:

- `cs_graph.js`
- `ece_graph.js`
- `ce_graph.js`
- `ee_graph.js`

following the instructions from the [course graph repository](https://github.com/hkn-alpha/coursegraph).
